		<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

		<h4>The views.zip file or views folder is old data</h4>
		<p>Check if you have multiple views.zip files (i.e. views.zip (1),
			views.zip (2)). A lot of times if you download files of the same name
			the browser auto-adds a counter (i.e. the (1), (2)) to the filename.</p>

		<h4>How do I ask for help?</h4>
		<p>Clearly define what the results you want are and in a detailed
			manor explain what steps you're doing to achieve that and where you
			think a step went wrong.</p>

		<h4>Who do I ask for help?</h4>
		<p>Whoever sent you this jar file</p>

		<h4>How do I ask for improvements?</h4>
		<p>(Pictures are almost required), explain in a detailed manor
			what capability the improvement does</p>

		<h4>Who do I ask for improvements?</h4>
		<p>Whoever sent you this jar file</p>

		<h4>Is this secure?</h4>
		<p>Everything is done locally on your own machine. Even though
			this is a webpage it's been served by your own system and makes no
			external calls. Therefore it adds no additional vulnerabilities (if
			your computer was already secure then this is too)</p>

		<h4>Should I be rooting for Vegas in the 2017-2018 NHL Season</h4>
		<p>You can do whatever you want</p>
